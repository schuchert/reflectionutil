OS X Users:
   This does not appear to compile with the 1.5 compiler (though it does in
   eclipse). I am using Java 1.6 to compile it. However, it seems that using
   the Java Preferences to set the JDK to 1.6 does not correctly set the
   links for JAVA_HOME. I had to add the following environment variable:
      export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home
